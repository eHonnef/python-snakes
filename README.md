# Python snakes

Little christmas project (merry christmas :D) while I was bored.  
So basically a snakes game made in python using tkinter and nothing more.

## Requirements and usage

Check `requirements.txt` and install using pip. `pip install -r requirements`.  
Run `Main.py` (not the river) to play.  
Have fun :).

## What's missing?

There is only one level, no walls (Trump will be disappointed) and the logic to "reappear" in the other side is not implemented (the famous [Wraparound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wraparound_(video_games))).  
And I think that the `Objects` class could be better implemented.
